# PDB benchmarks

Open source software to parse [Protein Data Bank](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do) (PDB) files and manipulate protein structures exists in many languages, usually as part of Bio* projects.

This repository aims to collate benchmarks for common tasks across various languages.

Disclosure: I contributed the `Bio.Structure` module to BioJulia.

Please feel free to contribute scripts from other languages, or improve the scripts already present.
